# jQuery to React Migration Exercise

This exercise is aimed at migrating a simple task list application from jQuery and HTML to React. The goal is to recreate the functionality using React components and state management.

## Requirements

To complete this exercise, you will need:

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine
- A code editor of your choice
- Basic knowledge of HTML, JavaScript, and React

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your code editor.
3. Install the dependencies by running `npm install` in the project directory.
4. Start the development server with `npm start`.

## Task

Your task is to migrate the provided jQuery and HTML code to React. You will need to create React components and manage state to recreate the functionality of the task list application.

The original jQuery and HTML code is located in the `src/index.html` file. You can refer to it as a reference while building the React components.

## Steps to Follow

1. Create a new React component for the task list application.
2. Implement the necessary state management using React's `useState` hook.
3. Replace the jQuery event handlers with React event handlers.
4. Update the HTML markup to JSX syntax within the React components.

Feel free to use any additional libraries or tools you are comfortable with to complete the migration.

## Submission

Once you have completed the migration, you can submit your solution by creating a pull request or sharing your code with the interviewer.

Good luck with the migration! If you have any questions, feel free to ask.
